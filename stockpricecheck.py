    # An additional strategy is called the opportunity-cost sell method.
    # In this method, the investor owns a portfolio of stocks and sells a stock when a better opportunity presents itself.
    # This requires constant monitoring, research, and analysis of both their portfolio and potential new stock additions.
    # Once a better potential investment has been identified, the investor then reduces or eliminates a position in a current
    # holding that isn't expected to do as well as the new stock on a risk-adjusted return basis.

    sharp_ratio = (R_p-R_f)/s_p
    where
    R_p: return of portfolio
    R_f: risk-free rate
    s_p: standard deviation of the portfolios excess returns

    Subtract the risk-free rate from the return of the portfolio. The risk-free rate could be a U.S. Treasury rate or yield, such as the 
    one-year or two-year Treasury yield.
    Divide the result by the standard deviation of the portfolioâ€™s excess return. 
    The standard deviation helps to show how much the portfolio's return deviates from the expected return. 
    The standard deviation also sheds light on the portfolio's volatility.
