Infrastructure
TODO: Don't use 100% of available funds by default
TODO: log top three stocks and associated results. Perhaps plot those equity curves
TODO: Consider currently open trades when computing longest held positions (and multiple other trade statistics)
TODO: Fix sharpe and sortino ratios. (Compute these on a real trade-day basis, not an unrealised state-basis)
TODO: use backtest statistics to create signals for bad-performing strategies
TODO: develop infrastructure to apply multiple strategies
TODO: indicator library (see https://github.com/voice32/stock_market_indicators/blob/master/indicators.py)
TODO: do not buy all portfolio in the pool. Use only those that historically played well with current strategy
TODO: check out quantstats for reporting
TODO: if input tickers is not 'all' we should plot the chosen index/stock

Data
TODO: make all data providers fit into current infrastructure
TODO: find c25 dataset
TODO: get Tiingo dataset
